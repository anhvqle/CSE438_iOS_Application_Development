Creative Portions: Implement Simple Navigation Buttons for User instead of pressing animal buttons

1. What I Implemented
- I implemented left and right buttons on screen to provide users with an easier way to navigate through the desired animals. The app is designed for users at a younger age, which might find it difficult to use the buttons. Therefore, I believe having buttons to move back and forth between animals can be a helpful features. Even though it is a small feature, these two buttons will be of great help for users who prefer faster changing. The buttons still follow the order of the given animals (Dog - Cat - Bird - Bunny - Fish) to maintain a fixed order of the five animals. 

2. How I implemented it: 
- First, I declared a global variable name globalTag to keep track of the tag of the current animal. Dog's tag number is 0, and it is 1, 2, 3, 4 for Cat, Bird, Bunny, and Fish respectively. These buttons should change the tag or previous or after animals accordingly. When the tag is updated, I also changed the picture as well as states of the animal to not lose the play process. Everything works fine when it comes to user testing. 

3. Why I implemented it:
- Since the app is supposed to serve kids at a younger age, some might find it hard to use and for foreign users who do not understand English, having an image button to navigate through the animals can be helpful.
