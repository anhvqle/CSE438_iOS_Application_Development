## How I implemented it ##
1. For the movie trailer option, I added an UIButton that sends the movie's title name and embedded it as an URLRequest to a WebViewController that implements WebKit WKNNavigationDelegate. A WKWebView, that links to YouTube, was created on top of the navigation stack. 


## Why I implemented it ##
1. When it comes to movies, it is a must for users to have access to every movie's trailer video. Therefore, I believe one simple functionality is to give users the option to watch those trailer videos on YouTube before deciding to add them to their favorite list or not.
